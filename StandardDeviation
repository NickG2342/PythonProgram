#copy the average() function here, you'll need to call it to calculate the sample standard deviation

# Define a function std_dev(), which calculates the sample standard deviation of a list of numbers
def std_dev(list):
  #call average(), calculate the difference, get the total of difference * difference
  #also get the count of the observations or n, you'll need n-1 which is the degrees of freedom
  #the variance is the total divided by n-1
  return something #the square root of the variance

#call the function, using a list of numbers as input
#the sample standard deviation of 6,3,10,56,2 is 22.908513701242168
print(std_dev([6,3,10,56,2]))
