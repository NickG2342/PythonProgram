Use what you learn in the examples to write code in "StandardDeviation" that will calculate the sample standard deviation of a list of numbers.

For info on the sample standard deviation:

To calculate the sample standard deviation, you will need to calculate the sum of squared differences. The difference being an observation minus the mean (or average). To square the difference, just multiply the difference by itself. Using a loop, you can sum (or add) the squared differences just like you added the observations to get the total in the average() function. In that same loop, you can count the observations as in the average() function. You then divide the sum of squared differences by one less than the count of observations (i.e., N-1 or the degrees of freedom). You now have the sample variance. The square root of the sample variance is the sample standard deviation.
